# Sound 150%

## Summary

This sound150@claudiux applet is an improvement of the sound@cinnamon.org applet.

An option allows you to control the volume up to 150% of its nominal value.

The icon and the slider are coloured according to the volume when it is greater than 100%.

A mark on sliders signals the '100%' position of volume.

From 0 to 100%: standard icons.

Note that the icons are those of the system.

An option in settings allows you to don't display colors.

## Usage

 * In the settings (accessed by right-clicking on the icon), the ***Maximum volume control*** option sets the percentage of
nominal volume you want to limit the maximum volume. Possible values are between 30% and 150%. From Cinnamon 4.4, Cinnamon Settings are used to set this value.

Use with caution. Above 120%, saturation can make the sound very unpleasant, even agressive.

In a meeting room or classroom, it is often useful to be able to increase the volume beyond 100%.

On the computer of a child, reduce the maximum volume possible to take care of his hearing... and yours!


 * You can also choose the value of incrementation/decrementation (+/-) of the volume (in % of nominal volume).

 * If you don't want colors, an option allows you to keep the standard color.
