This is a simple applet for searching special ascii characters. You can type the name of any character that is not found on a regular keyboard, and it will provide buttons containing the character that will copy it to your clipboard. The charcter can can be pasted with the middle mouse button, or whatever button you would normally use to paste highlighted text. 

All of the code was written by myself. I quickly created the icons in inkscape, with the main one being inspired by the default character map logo (accented lowercase 'a').
