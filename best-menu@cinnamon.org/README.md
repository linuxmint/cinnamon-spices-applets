This is the menu applet from Cinnamon 6.4.

I tested it in Linux Mint 22.3 (with Cinnamon 6.6) and it works. I tested it in LMDE 7 (with Cinnamon 6.6) and it works.

..........................................................................

I saved the directory "menu@cinnamon.org" from Cinnamon 6.4.

I changed the name of the directory to "best-menu@cinnamon.org" because you won't want two applets with the same name.

I added an icon to the directory.

In the file "metadata.json" I changed the uuid to "best-menu@cinnamon.org". I changed the text for "name" to "Best Menu" and I changed the text for "description" to "This is the Menu applet from Cinnamon 6.4.".

In the file "applet.js" there is one place where the name "menu@cinnamon.org" appears. I changed it to "best-menu@cinnamon.org".

I made no other changes.

This is the menu applet most people prefer. There's a poll on the Linux Mint forums which shows that 52% of Mint customers prefer the Cinnamon 6.4 menu.
