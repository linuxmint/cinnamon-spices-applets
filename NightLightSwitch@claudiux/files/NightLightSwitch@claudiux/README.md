# Night Light Switch

Interface for the Night Light mode found in Cinnamon 6.4 settings. One click to deactivate Night Light mode, another to activate it.


(This applet is intended to be temporary, until the official one is released in Cinnamon 6.6.)

With Cinnamon 6.6+, you can use the _nightlight@cinnamon.org_ applet instead.
