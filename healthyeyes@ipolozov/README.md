# Healthy Eyes

Quiet reminder to take a break every half an hour. When the circle is red, give your eyes a rest by looking away from your monitor, then click the circle.

This reminder is made without annoying notifications, just a silent color change for you to notice, every half an hour.
Code is *heavily inspired* by InternetTimeApplet from stefan.
