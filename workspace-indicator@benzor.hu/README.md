# Workspace Indicator

This applet is a simple alternative to the default "Workspace switcher" applet that takes up minimal space on a panel.
It displays only a single button showing the number of the current workspace.

* Clicking the button triggers the Expo view (workspace grid).
* Scrolling on the button switches workspace.

Either behaviours can be turned off in the settings.
