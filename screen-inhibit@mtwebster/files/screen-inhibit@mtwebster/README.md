## Screensaver Inhibitor

This is a simple applet for Cinnamon that lets you inhibit/allow the usual screensaver operation by clicking on its icon.

Its original author is @mtwebster, who did a great job! Many thanks to him.

This applet must not be used in conjunction with the *inhibit@cinnamon.org* applet. Choose one or the other.

### Settings
This applet works out of the box; so you can ignore the settings. But there are several:

  * Select the icons.
  * Reset to default icons.
  * Keybinding.
  * Whether or not to inhibit the screensaver at startup.
