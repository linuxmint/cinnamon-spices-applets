Please explain your problem in issues- with screenshots. Feature requests are welcome, but please make them in my github and not the official Cinnamon Spices website.

## FAQ
#### 1) Is it possible to have stats for the words I've learned?
Yes, I'm working on it. This will happen once I have some free time.

Probably works. If it doesn't, please file an [issue][issue].
