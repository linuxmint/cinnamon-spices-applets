Maximus Buttons
--------------------

This applet is desinged to work in pair with:

* maximus-title@hanspr
* maximus extension to remove the title bar on maximized windows
* Multiple monitors: Add the applet to panels in all monitors to set the buttons on the active window monitor
* Multiple monitors: buttons will be visible on the current focused monitor window to improve focus visibility between monitors

# Features
* It will show the minimize, maximize, close buttons on the panel when a window is maximized
* It only makes sense with Maximus extension, because you loose those buttons, after maximize

# How to configure
* Install the applet
* Add applet with the plus sign
* Edit the panel and reposition the applet at the far right or left of your panel.
* It feels more natural when the panel is on the top, but it will work on bottom panels as well

# Limitations
* No consideration for vertical panels, it's been tested on horizontal panels only

# Errors
* Please report any errors in github `https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/issues`
* Add `@hanspr` at the beggining of your comment to be notified of your request
