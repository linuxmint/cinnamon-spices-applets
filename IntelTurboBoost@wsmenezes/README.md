## Description

**cinnamon-applet-IntelTurboBoost** is a simple systray applet designed for Cinnamon desktop environments.

**Intel Turbo Boost©** is a remarkable technology, yet there are numerous reports on the Internet regarding potential 
instability, ranging from system crashes to thermal throttling. 

Most of the time these issues are related to the motherboard, not the processor itself. In my case the root cause was a 
well known issue regarding my motherboard [VRM](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/vrm-voltage-regulator-module-definition,5771.html). Budget motherboards...

Until I discovered and fixed my issue I had to disable **Intel Turbo Boost©** at **BIOS** whenever I wanted to have a 
stable system for critical tasks.

This applet simplifies the process of enabling or disabling **Intel Turbo Boost©** while your system is running, 
eliminating the need for a full system reboot. If you are struggling with **Intel Turbo Boost©**, here are some 
scenarios in which you might consider disabling the feature (for the moment at least):

+ Banking applications.
+ Avoiding thermal throttling.
+ Achieving extreme power savings.

**Important:** Please be aware that if **Intel Turbo Boost©** is disabled at the BIOS level, 
this applet **cannot override** those settings. It serves as a convenient in-session toggle 
for **Intel Turbo Boost©**.
