Version 2.0.5
0.9.0 Release Candidate 30-07-2013
0.9.1 Help file facility added and link to gnome-system-monitor
0.9.2 Change Hold to Pause in Tooltip
0.9.3 Beautified at http://jsbeautifier.org/ and a few more comments 14-08-2013
0.9.4 Major improvement - only run updateLoop() when counter running to save processor
      This is important if you have multiple instances as each would consume processor 
      even when not running.
0.9.5 Added a Checkbox to Settings giving option to continue counting from paused. 
      Normal sequence on clicking is 'start -> pause -> reset' 
      In optional mode this changes to 'start -> pause -> continue -> pause etc'.
      In this mode one has to use th Right Click (Context) Menu to reset. 15-08-2013
0.9.6 Refinement of Tooltip text. 15-08-2013
0.9.6 Removed Simple from Title. Custom Icon in folder and icon line removed from metadata.json
      (alternative is line "icon": "appointment-new") and follow theme 17-08-2013
0.9.7 Major change to single counterStatus from a series of flags
0.9.8 counterStatus, currentCount and startTime are now stored as Settings variables
      so the counter is not reset by a cinnamon reset.
0.9.9 New variable pauseAt added and replaces currentCount in Settings to reduce the load on Settings 
      as it is updated only at time of counter being paused.
      Changed to call a null function when a generic setting changed rather than a UI update. 25-08-2013
1.0.0 Initial version on Cinnamon Spices web site 01-09-2013
1.1.0 Quick fix to background colours to use transparency so they work with light and dark themes 02-09-2013
1.1.1 Added radiused border to background colours and made them configurable via a stylesheet 
      (stylesheet.css in the applet folder). Extra menu item added to open stylesheet.css 04-09-2013
1.1.2 Took opportunity to change from red background when days greater than 1 to a red border
      so one still knows if it is paused or counting 
1.2.0 Inhibit counter updates after counter removed from panel
1.2.1 Modifications for Cinnamon 2 by adding cinnamonVersion to settings
      to allow Cinnamon Version to be specified and thus inhibit extra settings menu entry
1.2.2 Change 'Settings' to 'Configure..' and place after housekeping for consistency
1.2.3 Pick up Cinnamon Version from environment variable CINNAMON_VERSION rather than settings window 
2.0.0 Use Cinnamon version to choose text editor to start to look at changelog etc
2.0.2 01-02-2017 Change helpfile to use README.md instead of help.txt in applet folder
      Remove icon.png and help.txt from applet folder
2.0.3 Version numbering harmonised with other Cinnamon applets and added to metadata.json so it shows in 'About...'
      icon.png copied back into applet folder so it shows in 'About...'
2.0.4 Bug corrected at line 138 this.currentCount had comma, not stop.
      Use of this.UUID = metadata.uuid removed (only used in Config... for Cinnamon <2.0) which makes use of UUID in l10n more obvious.
2.0.5 Improved l10n Support:
        UUID set from metadata.uuid so no need for explicit definition.
        _() function now checks for system translations if a local one not found.
        Based on ideas from @Odyseus, @lestcape and @NikoKrause
