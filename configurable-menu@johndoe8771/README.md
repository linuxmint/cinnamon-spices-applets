# Description

At the end of 2025, Cinnamon 6.6 debuted a redesigned start menu. While many users preferred the new layout, quite a few did not. While I on the whole quite liked the new design, there were a few customization options I felt it sorely lacked, most notably the ability to make the system buttons vertical and remove sidebar text. This fork of the Cinnamon Menu applet adds the following customization options:

* Stack the system buttons vertically in the sidebar
* Disable names/descriptions for sidebar elements
* Use symbolic icons for system buttons
* Resize system buttons

Additional functionality will likely be added in the future.
