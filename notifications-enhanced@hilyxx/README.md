Notifications Enhanced applet
-------------------
This applet is a fork of the original Notification applet developed for the Cinnamon Desktop, enhanced with additional options for easier notification management.

#### Features

* New panel icon when Do Not Disturb mode is enabled.
* Updated menu label when Do Not Disturb mode is active.
* Toggle switch in the menu to easily enable or disable notifications.
* Tooltip now displays the number of notifications.
* New keyboard shortcut to enable or disable notifications.
* Middle-click on a notification to dismiss it.

⚠️ To avoid code conflicts (as both applets share parts of the same code), please remove the vanilla Notification applet before installing Notifications Enhanced, then restart Cinnamon.
