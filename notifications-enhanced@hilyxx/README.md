Notifications Enhanced applet
-------------------
This applet is a fork of the notification applet developed for Cinnamon Desktop, but with more options to manage notifications easily.

#### Features
* New icon on the panel when "Do not disturb" mod is enabled.
* New menu label when "Do not disturb" mod is enabled.
* New toggle switch in the menu to easily enable/disable notifications.
* New option to show "do not disturb" icon on the panel when show empty tray option is disabled.
* Tooltip now displays notification count.

To prevent code conflicts (both applets share part of the same code), remove the vanilla applet, install the 'notifications enhanced' applet, and restart Cinnamon.
