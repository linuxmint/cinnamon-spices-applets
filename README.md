This is a simple applet for searching special ascii characters. You can type the name/description of any character that is not found on a regular keyboard, and it will provide buttons containing the character that will copy it to your clipboard. The charcter can can be pasted with Control V.

All of the code was written by leadedyogurt. I created the icons in inkscape.
