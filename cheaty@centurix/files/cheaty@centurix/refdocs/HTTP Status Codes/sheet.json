		"Information (1xx)": {
			"100 Continue": {
				"description": "The 100 (Continue) status code indicates that the initial part of a request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The server intends to send a final response after the request  has been fully received and acted upon. When the request contains an Expect header field that includes a 100-continue expectation, the 100 response indicates that the server wishes to receive the request payload body, as described in Section 5.1.1. The client ought to continue sending the request and discard the 100 response. If the request did not contain an Expect header field containing the 100-continue expectation, the client can simply discard this interim response.",
				"code": "100 Continue"
			},
			"101 Switching Protocols": {
				"description": "The 101 (Switching Protocols) status code indicates that the server understands and is willing to comply with the client's request, via the Upgrade header field (Section 6.7 of [RFC7230]), for a change in the application protocol being used on this connection.  The server MUST generate an Upgrade header field in the response that indicates which protocol(s) will be switched to immediately after the empty line that terminates the 101 response.\nIt is assumed that the server will only agree to switch protocols when it is advantageous to do so.  For example, switching to a newer version of HTTP might be advantageous over older versions, and switching to a real-time, synchronous protocol might be advantageous when delivering resources that use such features.",
				"code": "101 Switching Protocols"
			}
		},
		"Success (2xx)": {
			"200 OK": {
				"description": "The 200 (OK) status code indicates that the request has succeeded.  The payload sent in a 200 response depends on the request method.  For the methods defined by this specification, the intended meaningof the payload can be summarized as:\nGET - a representation of the target resource;\nHEAD - the same representation as GET, but without the representation data;\nPOST - a representation of the status of, or results obtained from, the action;\nPUT, DELETE - a representation of the status of the action;\nOPTIONS - a representation of the communications options;\nTRACE - a representation of the request message as received by the end server.\nAside from responses to CONNECT, a 200 response always has a payload, though an origin server MAY generate a payload body of zero length.  If no payload is desired, an origin server ought to send 204 (No Content) instead.  For CONNECT, no payload is allowed because the successful result is a tunnel, which begins immediately after the 200 response header section.\nA 200 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]).",
				"code": "200 OK"
			},
			"201 Created": {
				"description": "The 201 (Created) status code indicates that the request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.  The primary resource created by the request is identified by either a Location header field in the response or, if no Location field is received, by the effective request URI.\nThe 201 response payload typically describes and links to the resource(s) created.  See Section 7.2 for a discussion of the meaning and purpose of validator header fields, such as ETag and Last-Modified, in a 201 response.",
				"code": "201 Created"
			},
			"202 Accepted": {
				"description": "The 202 (Accepted) status code indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.  The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place.  There is no facility in HTTP for re-sending a status code from an asynchronous operation.\nThe 202 response is intentionally noncommittal.  Its purpose is to allow a server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without requiring that the user agent's connection to the server persist until the process is completed.  The representation sent with this response ought to describe the request's current status and point to (or embed) a status monitor that can provide the user with an estimate of when the request will be fulfilled.",
				"code": "202 Accepted"
			},
			"203 Non-Authoritative Information": {
				"description": "The 203 (Non-Authoritative Information) status code indicates that the request was successful but the enclosed payload has been modified from that of the origin server's 200 (OK) response by a transforming proxy (Section 5.7.2 of [RFC7230]).  This status code allows the proxy to notify recipients when a transformation has been applied, since that knowledge might impact later decisions regarding the content.  For example, future cache validation requests for the content might only be applicable along the same request path (through the same proxies).\nThe 203 response is similar to the Warning code of 214 Transformation Applied (Section 5.5 of [RFC7234]), which has the advantage of being applicable to responses with any status code.A 203 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]).",
				"code": "203 Non-Authoritative Information"
			},
			"204 No Content": {
				"description": "The 204 (No Content) status code indicates that the server has successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body.  Metadata in the response header fields refer to the target resource and its selected representation after the requested action was applied.\nFor example, if a 204 status code is received in response to a PUT request and the response contains an ETag header field, then the PUT was successful and the ETag field-value contains the entity-tag for the new representation of that target resource.\nThe 204 response allows a server to indicate that the action has been successfully applied to the target resource, while implying that the user agent does not need to traverse away from its current 'document view' (if any).  The server assumes that the user agent will provide some indication of the success to its user, in accord with its own interface, and apply any new or updated metadata in the response to its active representation.\nFor example, a 204 status code is commonly used with document editing interfaces corresponding to a 'save' action, such that the document being saved remains available to the user for editing.  It is also frequently used with interfaces that expect automated data transfers to be prevalent, such as within distributed version control systems.\nA 204 response is terminated by the first empty line after the header fields because it cannot contain a message body.\nA 204 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]).",
				"code": "204 No Content"
			},
			"205 Reset Content": {
				"description": "The 205 (Reset Content) status code indicates that the server has fulfilled the request and desires that the user agent reset the 'document view', which caused the request to be sent, to its original state as received from the origin server.\nThis response is intended to support a common data entry use case where the user receives content that supports data entry (a form, notepad, canvas, etc.), enters or manipulates data in that space, causes the entered data to be submitted in a request, and then the data entry mechanism is reset for the next entry so that the user can easily initiate another input action.\nSince the 205 status code implies that no additional content will be provided, a server MUST NOT generate a payload in a 205 response.  In other words, a server MUST do one of the following for a 205 response: a) indicate a zero-length body for the response by including a Content-Length header field with a value of 0; b) indicate a zero-length payload for the response by including a Transfer-Encoding header field with a value of chunked and a message body consisting of a single chunk of zero-length; or, c) close the connection immediately after sending the blank line terminating the header section.",
				"code": "205 Reset Content"
			}
		},
		"Redirection (3xx)": {
			"300 Multiple Choices": {
				"description": "The 300 (Multiple Choices) status code indicates that the target resource has more than one representation, each with its own more specific identifier, and information about the alternatives is being provided so that the user (or user agent) can select a preferred representation by redirecting its request to one or more of those identifiers.  In other words, the server desires that the user agent engage in reactive negotiation to select the most appropriate representation(s) for its needs (Section 3.4).\nIf the server has a preferred choice, the server SHOULD generate a Location header field containing a preferred choice's URI reference. The user agent MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection.\nFor request methods other than HEAD, the server SHOULD generate a payload in the 300 response containing a list of representation metadata and URI reference(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most preferred.  The user agent MAY make a selection from that list automatically if it understands the provided media type.  A specific format for automatic selection is not defined by this specification because HTTP tries to remain orthogonal to the definition of its payloads.  In practice, the representation is provided in some easily parsed format believed to be acceptable to the user agent, as determined by shared design or content negotiation, or in some commonly accepted hypertext format.A 300 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]).\n Note: The original proposal for the 300 status code defined the URI header field as providing a list of alternative representations, such that it would be usable for 200, 300, and 406 responses and be transferred in responses to the HEAD method. However, lack of deployment and disagreement over syntax led to both URI and Alternates (a subsequent proposal) being dropped from this specification.  It is possible to communicate the list using a set of Link header fields [RFC5988], each with a relationship of 'alternate', though deployment is a chicken-and-egg problem.",
				"code": "300 Multiple Choices"
			},
			"301 Moved Permanently": {
				"description": "The 301 (Moved Permanently) status code indicates that the target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs. Clients with link-editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link references to the effective request URI to one or more of the new references sent by the server, where possible.\n The server SHOULD generate a Location header field in the response containing a preferred URI reference for the new permanent URI.  The user agent MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection.  The server's response payload usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).\n Note: For historical reasons, a user agent MAY change the request method from POST to GET for the subsequent request.  If this behavior is undesired, the 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code can be used instead.\n A 301 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]).",
				"code": "301 Moved Permanently"
			},
			"302 Found": {
				"description": "The 302 (Found) status code indicates that the target resource resides temporarily under a different URI.  Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client ought to continue to use the effective request URI for future requests. The server SHOULD generate a Location header field in the response containing a URI reference for the different URI.  The user agent MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection.  The server's response payload usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the different URI(s).\n Note: For historical reasons, a user agent MAY change the request method from POST to GET for the subsequent request.  If this behavior is undesired, the 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code can be used instead.",
				"code": "302 Found"
			},
			"303 See Other": {
				"description": "The 303 (See Other) status code indicates that the server is redirecting the user agent to a different resource, as indicated by a URI in the Location header field, which is intended to provide an indirect response to the original request.  A user agent can perform a retrieval request targeting that URI (a GET or HEAD request if using HTTP), which might also be redirected, and present the eventual result as an answer to the original request.  Note that the new URI in the Location header field is not considered equivalent to the effective request URI.\n This status code is applicable to any HTTP method.  It is primarily used to allow the output of a POST action to redirect the user agent to a selected resource, since doing so provides the information corresponding to the POST response in a form that can be separately identified, bookmarked, and cached, independent of the original request.\n A 303 response to a GET request indicates that the origin server does not have a representation of the target resource that can be transferred by the server over HTTP.  However, the Location field value refers to a resource that is descriptive of the target resource, such that making a retrieval request on that other resource might result in a representation that is useful to recipients without implying that it represents the original target resource.  Note that answers to the questions of what can be represented, what representations are adequate, and what might be a useful description are outside the scope of HTTP.\n Except for responses to a HEAD request, the representation of a 303 response ought to contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the same URI reference provided in the Location header field.",
				"code": "303 See Other"
			},
			"305 Use Proxy": {
				"description": "The 305 (Use Proxy) status code was defined in a previous version of this specification and is now deprecated (Appendix B).",
				"code": "305 Use Proxy"
			},
			"307 Temporary Redirect": {
				"description": "The 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code indicates that the target resource resides temporarily under a different URI and the user agent MUST NOT change the request method if it performs an automatic redirection to that URI.  Since the redirection can change over time, the client ought to continue using the original effective request URI for future requests.\n The server SHOULD generate a Location header field in the response containing a URI reference for the different URI.  The user agent MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection.  The server's response payload usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the different URI(s).\n Note: This status code is similar to 302 (Found), except that it does not allow changing the request method from POST to GET.  This specification defines no equivalent counterpart for 301 (Moved Permanently) ([RFC7238], however, defines the status code 308 (Permanent Redirect) for this purpose).",
				"code": "307 Temporary Redirect"
			}
		},
		"Client Error (4xx)": {
			"400 Bad Request": {
				"description": "The 400 (Bad Request) status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).",
				"code": "400 Bad Request"
			},
			"402 Payment Required": {
				"description": "The 402 (Payment Required) status code is reserved for future use.",
				"code": "402 Payment Required"
			},
			"403 Forbidden": {
				"description": "The 403 (Forbidden) status code indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.  A server that wishes to make public why the request has been forbidden can describe that reason in the response payload (if any).\n If authentication credentials were provided in the request, the server considers them insufficient to grant access.  The client SHOULD NOT automatically repeat the request with the same credentials.  The client MAY repeat the request with new or different credentials.  However, a request might be forbidden for reasons unrelated to the credentials.\n An origin server that wishes to 'hide' the current existence of a forbidden target resource MAY instead respond with a status code of 404 (Not Found).",
				"code": "403 Forbidden"
			},
			"404 Not Found": {
				"description": "The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists.  A 404 status code does not indicate whether this lack of representation is temporary or permanent; the 410 (Gone) status code is preferred over 404 if the origin server knows, presumably through some configurable means, that the condition is likely to be permanent.\n A 404 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]).",
				"code": "404 Not Found"
			},
			"405 Method Not Allowed": {
				"description": "The 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code indicates that the method received in the request-line is known by the origin server but not supported by the target resource.  The origin server MUST generate an Allow header field in a 405 response containing a list of the target resource's currently supported methods.\n A 405 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]).",
				"code": "405 Method Not Allowed"
			},
			"406 Not Acceptable": {
				"description": "The 406 (Not Acceptable) status code indicates that the target resource does not have a current representation that would be acceptable to the user agent, according to the proactive negotiation header fields received in the request (Section 5.3), and the server is unwilling to supply a default representation.\n The server SHOULD generate a payload containing a list of available representation characteristics and corresponding resource identifiers from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate.  A user agent MAY automatically select the most appropriate choice from that list.  However, this specification does not define any standard for such automatic selection, as described in Section 6.4.1.",
				"code": "406 Not Acceptable"
			},
			"408 Request Timeout": {
				"description": "The 408 (Request Timeout) status code indicates that the server did not receive a complete request message within the time that it was prepared to wait.  A server SHOULD send the 'close' connection option (Section 6.1 of [RFC7230]) in the response, since 408 implies that the server has decided to close the connection rather than continue waiting.  If the client has an outstanding request in transit, the client MAY repeat that request on a new connection.",
				"code": "408 Request Timeout"
			},
			"409 Conflict": {
				"description": "The 409 (Conflict) status code indicates that the request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.  This code is used in situations where the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request.  The server SHOULD generate a payload that includes enough information for a user to recognize the source of the conflict.\n Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request.  For example, if versioning were being used and the representation being PUT included changes to a resource that conflict with those made by an earlier (third-party) request, the origin server might use a 409 response to indicate that it can't complete the request.  In this case, the response representation would likely contain information useful for merging the differences based on the revision history.",
				"code": "409 Conflict"
			},
			"410 Gone": {
				"description": "The 410 (Gone) status code indicates that access to the target resource is no longer available at the origin server and that this condition is likely to be permanent.  If the origin server does not know, or has no facility to determine, whether or not the condition is permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) ought to be used instead.\n The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web maintenance by notifying the recipient that the resource is intentionally unavailable and that the server owners desire that remote links to that resource be removed.  Such an event is common for limited-time, promotional services and for resources belonging to individuals no longer associated with the origin server's site.  It is not necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as 'gone' or to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left to the discretion of the server owner.\n A 410 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]).",
				"code": "410 Gone"
			},
			"411 Length Required": {
				"description": "The 411 (Length Required) status code indicates that the server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length (Section 3.3.2 of [RFC7230]).  The client MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid Content-Length header field containing the length of the message body in the request message.",
				"code": "411 Length Required"
			},
			"413 Payload Too Large": {
				"description": "The 413 (Payload Too Large) status code indicates that the server is refusing to process a request because the request payload is larger than the server is willing or able to process.  The server MAY close the connection to prevent the client from continuing the request.\n If the condition is temporary, the server SHOULD generate a Retry-After header field to indicate that it is temporary and after what time the client MAY try again.",
				"code": "413 Payload Too Large"
			},
			"414 URI Too Long": {
				"description": "The 414 (URI Too Long) status code indicates that the server is refusing to service the request because the request-target (Section 5.3 of [RFC7230]) is longer than the server is willing to interpret. This rare condition is only likely to occur when a client has improperly converted a POST request to a GET request with long query information, when the client has descended into a 'black hole' of redirection (e.g., a redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of itself) or when the server is under attack by a client attempting to exploit potential security holes. A 414 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]).",
				"code": "414 URI Too Long"
			},
			"415 Unsupported Media Type": {
				"description": "The 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code indicates that the origin server is refusing to service the request because the payload is in a format not supported by this method on the target resource. The format problem might be due to the request's indicated Content-Type or Content-Encoding, or as a result of inspecting the data directly.",
				"code": "415 Unsupported Media Type"
			},
			"417 Expectation Failed": {
				"description": "The 417 (Expectation Failed) status code indicates that the expectation given in the request's Expect header field (Section 5.1.1) could not be met by at least one of the inbound servers.",
				"code": "417 Expectation Failed"
			},
			"426 Upgrade Required": {
				"description": "The 426 (Upgrade Required) status code indicates that the server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol.  The server MUST send an Upgrade header field in a 426 response to indicate the required protocol(s) (Section 6.7 of [RFC7230]).",

				"code": "500 Internal Server Error"
			},
			"501 Not Implemented": {
				"description": "The 501 (Not Implemented) status code indicates that the server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.  This is the appropriate response when the server does not recognize the request method and is not capable of supporting it for any resource.\n A 501 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]).",
				"code": "501 Not Implemented"

			},
			"503 Service Unavailable": {
				"description": "The 503 (Service Unavailable) status code indicates that the server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance, which will likely be alleviated after some delay.  The server MAY send a Retry-After header field (Section 7.1.3) to suggest an appropriate amount of time for the client to wait before retrying the request.\n Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a server has to use it when becoming overloaded.  Some servers might simply refuse the connection.",
				"code": "503 Service Unavailable"
			},
			"504 Gateway Timeout": {

			},
			"505 HTTP Version Not Supported": {
				"description": "The 505 (HTTP Version Not Supported) status code indicates that the server does not support, or refuses to support, the major version of HTTP that was used in the request message.  The server is indicating that it is unable or unwilling to complete the request using the same major version as the client, as described in Section 2.6 of [RFC7230], other than with this error message.  The server SHOULD generate a representation for the 505 response that describes why that version is not supported and what other protocols are supported by that server.",
