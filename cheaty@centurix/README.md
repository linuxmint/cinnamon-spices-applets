# Cheaty #

Cheatsheet applet for Cinnamon.

### What does this applet do? ###

Cheaty is a quick way to access various cheatsheets from within the a single cinnamon applet. Click on the applet and a drop-down
menu of cheatsheets appears broken into sections on each topic and items describing the topic and code that is copied to the clipboard
when the menu item is clicked.

### What's here at the moment? ###

Currently, there are 5 cheatsheets that come with Cheaty: Git, Twitter Bootstrap, Markdown, HTTP Status Codes and SQL.

### Can I add my own cheat sheet or maybe contribute cheat sheets to this applet? ###

Totes. There's a template.json file in this project. If you have an SVG icon for the topic, then stick it all in a folder
in the refdocs area (or whatever folder you setup in the configuration of the applet). You can use the existing cheatsheets
as a reference.

### Isn't there an easier way to do this? ###

There should be. Open to suggestions on that.

### But why is this a thing? ###

Because I keep forgetting how to Markdown. And also, some Git stuff.
