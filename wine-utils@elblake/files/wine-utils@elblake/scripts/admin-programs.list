# Each line should be written similar to:
#
# ProgramName: % exename
#
# where exename is the wine program, either as a full path
# or the exe file itself if it is in wine's search paths.
#
# If the utility does not use wine to run, the percent symbol
# should be omitted and it will be run as a normal program.
#
# The % symbol at the beginning of the command line will be
# substituted with the wine command.
