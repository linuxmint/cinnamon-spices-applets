# Directory Menu for Cinnamon

Open a directory of your choice in a dropdown menu, offering a compact view and/or a faster navigation through the file tree.

This is a re-creation of a built-in feature in XFCE.

## Note

This is the work-in-progress repo of this applet's author. It is separate from the version found in the official [Cinnamon Spices repo](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets).

I like to keep this repo as a more detailed history of the early dev process, and in case I'm developing something new, this is where I'll commit the ongoing work until it's done.

But nowadays, **it's much more likely that this repo is out of date with respect to Cinnamon Spices**, which includes a number of awesome community contributions that I manually bring over here every once in a while. So, again, [go check out this applet on the official Linux Mint repo](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/tree/master/directory-menu%40torchipeppo)!

## Features

* View the selected directory as a compact list
* **Arbitrarily deep navigation through subdirectories**
* Fast navigation: just hover on a directory to open it
* Open any file by clicking on it
* "Open in Terminal" button for directories
* Configurable settings for handling hidden files, limiting menu width, and customization

## Installation

Download or clone this repo, then put the `directory-menu@torchipeppo` directory (contained in the `files` directory) into `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/`

## Compatibility

Developed, tested and extensively used by the author on Cinnamon 5.0.7.

Also tested successfully on Cinnamon 5.2 and Cinnamon 6.0.

May work on some previous versions, but it's untested there, so there's no guarantee.
