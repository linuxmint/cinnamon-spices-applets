# Directory Menu for Cinnamon

Open a directory of your choice in a dropdown menu, offering a compact view and/or a faster navigation through the file tree.

This is a re-creation of a built-in feature in XFCE.

## Features

* View the selected directory as a compact list
* **Arbitrarily deep navigation through subdirectories**
* Open any file by clicking on it
* "Open in Terminal" button for directories
* Configurable setting for showing or hiding hidden files

## Installation

Download or clone this repo, then put the `directory-menu@torchipeppo` directory (contained in the `files` directory) into `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/`

## Compatibility

Developed, tested and extensively used by the author on Cinnamon 5.0.7.

Also tested successfully on Cinnamon 5.2.

As of applet version 0.2, it should work on Cinnamon 6.0 (and previous) as well.
At least, it does on the author's VMs. Further tests are pending.
