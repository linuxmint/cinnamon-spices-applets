# Directory Menu for Cinnamon

Open a directory of your choice in a dropdown menu, offering a compact view and/or a faster navigation through the file tree.

This is a re-creation of a built-in feature in XFCE.

## Features

* View the selected directory as a compact list
* **Arbitrarily deep navigation through subdirectories**
* Open any file by clicking on it
* "Open in Terminal" button for directories
* Configurable setting for showing or hiding hidden files

## Installation

Download and extract the *content* of the `files` directory into `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/`

## Compatibility

Developed, tested and extensively used by the author on Cinnamon 5.0.5.

May work on a few previous versions, but there is no guarantee. Should work on later versions as well, as long as they are still based on GTK 3.
