# Directory Menu for Cinnamon

Open a directory of your choice in a dropdown menu, offering a compact view and/or a faster navigation through the file tree.

This is a re-creation of a built-in feature in XFCE.

## Features

* View the selected directory as a compact list
* **Arbitrarily deep navigation through subdirectories**
* Fast navigation: just hover on a directory to open it
* Open any file by clicking on it
* "Open in Terminal" button for directories
* Configurable settings for handling hidden files, limiting menu width, and customization

## Installation

Download or clone this repo, then put the `directory-menu@torchipeppo` directory (contained in the `files` directory) into `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/`

## Compatibility

Developed, tested and extensively used by the author on Cinnamon 5.0.7.

Also tested successfully on Cinnamon 5.2 and Cinnamon 6.0.

May work on some previous versions, but it's untested there, so there's no guarantee.
