# Microphone level monitor

This applet monitors microphone level (0-100%) by recording and analyzing quick samples of audio.

## Bluetooth devices features

There is an option to display microphone level only when active audio device is a bluetooth device with active HFP (handsfree) profile, so that, when e.g. connecting to a meeting we can see if device switched to HFP profile and we can test if its microphone works/is muted.

There is also an option to toggle switching to A2DP/HFP profile when clicking on applet icon - can come in handy when the device did not switched automatically to given profile.
