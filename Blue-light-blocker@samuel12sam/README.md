Blue Light Blocker
==========

>**Requirements:**
> The `xsct` package, which the user will be automatically prompted to install after installing **Blue Light Blocker**


 
This applet is the Linux Mint equivalent of '**Night Light**' (on Windows), and '**Night Shift**' (on macOS).

It acts as a blue light filter and makes your display use warmer colors, according to your likings. This applet, **Blue Light Blocker**, also allows you to control the brightness of your screen at will. 

Some applets are time-based, meaning they only block blue light at certain times of the day. The user has no control over the blue light filtering.

With Blue Light Blocker, however, you are in total control!

You can enable and disable this applet anytime in merely 2 clicks! 
Adjusting the warmth tone of your screen or it's brightness has never been easier, thanks to simple sliders with real-time feedback!


## Features
 * Easy to use
 * Not impacted by the time of the day
 * Somewhat customizable

- Translations for other languages
