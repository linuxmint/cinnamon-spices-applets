Uptime
======

**Uptime** is an applet that shows you how long it's been since last reboot.

The code for this applet can be found under uptime@vatanuki.kun here : [cinnamon-spices-applets](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/)

### Usage

* You can choose how to display the time in three different ways. Two predefined ways, and a third way where you define exactly how to present the time using :
  * **%y** for number of years
  * **%d** for number of days
  * **%h** for number of hours
  * **%m** for number of minutes
  * **%H** for number of hours with leading zero (if less than ten)
  * **%M** for number of minutes with leading zero (if less than ten)
* You can add a volentary prefix, for example : **Uptime :** 4 days and 3 hours
* You can choose a minimal mode, where only the icon will be shown in your panel, and the time will be presented (as choosen above) in a tooltip.
* You can show or hide the icon (in non-minimal mode)
* You can style the text (in non-minimal mode) with CSS
