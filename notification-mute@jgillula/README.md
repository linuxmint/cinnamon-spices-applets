# Notification-Mute
An applet just for muting notifications in the Cinnamon Linux desktop environment, based mostly on [screen-inhibit@mtwebster](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/tree/master/screen-inhibit%40mtwebster), but a little on [inhibit@cinnamon.org](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon/tree/7777f456326757c76f6edbfa4c15d858284a6842/files/usr/share/cinnamon/applets/inhibit%40cinnamon.org).
