# This currently contains a script file which you can modify 
# if required to satisfy your requirements.
# You need to install two programs for this script to run:
#    
#    Zenity which is a program that will display GTK+ dialogs, 
#    and returns (either in the return code, or on standard output)
#    the users input. This allows you to present information, and ask
#    for information from shell scripts. You can set timers if required.
#
#    Sox allows you to play an audio file as a warning -
#    you may need an extra library if you use mp3.
#
# Zenity and Sox can installed by
#    sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-mp3 zenity
#
# Modifications to this script are likely to be overwritten by  
# updates so back it up 


# Play a sound file as a separate process (Moved to applet from v32_1.0.0)
# play "/usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/alarm-clock-elapsed.oga" &
# Put up a warning with timer using Zenity
zenity --question --text="The Battery Level is dangerously low - the machine will be suspended shortly" --timeout=40 --ok-label="Suspend Immediately" --cancel-label="Abort Suspension" --title=WARNING_SUSPENDING_SHORTLY --window-icon=error --height=400 --width=750

if [ $rc = "0" ] || [ $rc = "5"    ]; then

zenity --warning --text="Machine was Suspended as the battery level was dangerously low" &
# wait a few seconds to stabilise then suspend.
# sleep 2
# Suspend via dbus in Mint 17.x follows

# Modified 07-07-2016 for Mint 18 using systemclt calls for suspend and added option of Suspend Immediately
# Modified 15-07-2016 to correct messages and spelling.
# Modified 27-07-2017 to remove sound file which is transfered to applet
