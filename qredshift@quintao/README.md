## Features
* Powerfull Interface.
* Scroll actions on panel icon.
* Keyboard Shortcuts.
* Temperature from 1000k to 9000k.
* Gamma from 0.5 to 5.
* Custom location option.
* Ready to Redshift 1.12

## Installation
1. Install Redshift:
    - Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint: `sudo apt-get install redshift`
    - Red Hat/Cent OS/Fedora: `sudo dnf install redshift`
2. Download zip from [this link](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/files/applets/qredshift@quintao.zip) and extract .zip archive to `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets`
    - Or automatically download it from Cinnamon Applets download tab.
3. Enable the applet in Cinnamon settings
4. Make sure you remove redshift-gtk `sudo apt-get remove redshift-gtk`
5. `~/.config/redshift.conf` may conflict with this applet, it is highly recommended removing it.
    - Applet will show a warning to remove it.
6. Make sure you disable redshift service `systemctl mask --user redshift.service`
    - Applet will automatically attempt to disable the default redshift service.
    - If you want to enable it again, run `systemctl unmask --user redshift.service`

## Changelog
* 1.7.0
    - Fixed issues with asynchronous command calls.
        - Main redshift call reverted to synchronous, so the cinnamon will show the annoying message again: ***This applet contains function calls that could potentially cause Cinnamon to crash or freeze***.
        - I noticed that on some (slow?) computers many asynchronous calls cause the application to freeze.
    - Added translations:
        - Spanish by [RichLuna](https://github.com/RichLuna "@RichLuna on Github")
