"Auto Scaling:\n"
"    This will scale the line graph by the largest reading within the\n"
"    displayed area. Once the largest reading is no longer displayed\n"
"    the next largest becomes the new value by which the readings\n"
"    are scaled. This lets the plot \"zoom\" to show details of the graph.\n"
"    However, it also means that if there is a large reading small readings\n"
"    may become indistinguishable from 0. And if there are only small "
"readings\n"
"    then slightly larger readings may appear larger than they should.\n"
"    If not enabled the largest value used will be the largest reading since\n"
"    cinnamon was started.\n"
"\n"
"Logarithmic Scaling:\n"
"    This transforms the readings so that they are displayed using a\n"
"    logarithmic scale. If you are not familiar basically, it reduces the\n"
"    large values so that they dont dominate the smaller readings."
