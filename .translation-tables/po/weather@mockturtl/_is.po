"If you have issues with the applet not working properly and you know the "
"User Agent string is the problem you can try to override it. Only change it "
"if you know what you are doing. This is a string that is sent to the server "
"when the applet tries to get the weather data."

"The applet will run the command you provide every time the weather data is "
"updated. The command will be interpolated with the same values with the same "
"format you can get in any of the overrides, in addition you get {full_data} "
"which is the full current weather data. Interpolation with single brackets "
"{xxx} will not be escaped, with double brackets {{xxxx}} they are wrapped in "
"single quotes (') and all other single quotes are escaped inside. You can "
"use this to integrate the weather data with other parts of your system. You "
"can look up the full weather data structure via the link in the README.\n"
"\n"
"Example: 'notify-send \"The weather is {c} and the temperature is {t}{u}\"' "
"will show a notification with the current weather condition and "
"temperature.\n"
"\n"
"Example: 'echo {{full_data}} > /tmp/weather_data' will save the full weather "
"data to a file in /tmp."
