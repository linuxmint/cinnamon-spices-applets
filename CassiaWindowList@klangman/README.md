This is a Cinnamon window list and panel launcher applet based on CobiWindowList with a number of additional features
designed to give you more control over how your window-list operates.

Recent new features (Aug-Dec 2023):

1.  Adjustable spacing between window-list buttons
2.  Ability to disable the new window animation
3.  Ability to change the icon saturation from grayscale (0%) to vivid (200%)
4.  Ability to show windows from other workspaces
5.  Restores custom group/ungroup application setting after reboot/cinnamon-restart
6.  Hotkey option to assign a set of 1-9 hotkeys to all window-list buttons
7.  Hotkey hints using the (`) grave key with any registered hotkey modifiers
8.  Added a Left-Click option to start new application windows in Launcher mode
9.  Ability to show a common set of pinned buttons on all workspaces
10. Smart numeric hotkeys to assign a set of 1-9 hotkeys to a specific application
11. A bunch of fixes

The design goals are to:

1. Allow you to declutter your window list when running many windows without having to do without button labels
2. Keyboard hot-keys to switch to specific windows so you don't have to reach for the mouse so often
3. Allow you to make full use of your mouse buttons to interact with the window list
4. A panel launcher that will activate existing windows rather then unconditionally launching new ones

## Requirements
This applet requires at least Cinnamon 4.0

## Installation
1. Right click on the cinnamon panel that you wish to add the CassiaWindowList to and click "Applets"
2. Click on the "Download" tab and select "Cassia Window List" and then click the install button on the right
3. Click on the "Manage Tab"
4. You most likely will want to disable the existing window-list applet you are using
5. Select the "Cassia Window List" entry and then click the "+" button at the bottom of the Applet window
6. The CassiaWindowList Basic Setup Wizard window will appear, follow the instructions to configure to your liking
7. Right click on the cinnamon panel and use "Panel edit mode" to enable moving the window-list within the panel
8. More configuration options: Right-click on any window-list button, "Applet Preferences" ->  "Configure..."

## Features
In addition to the features of the CobiWindowList...

 * Hotkeys: Assign hotkeys to windows and applications so you can switch-to/minimize/start application windows using the keyboard
 * Application pooling: Keeps all window list buttons from the same application together side by side
 * On demand application grouping: Allows for Group/Ungroup application windows on the fly
 * Label pooling: Show only one label when adjacent windows are for the same application
 * Automatic grouping/ungrouping: Group/ungroup windows for an application based on available space in the window list
 * Zoomable thumbnail windows: Thumbnail windows can be zoomed in or out using the mouse scroll wheel
 * Configurable mouse button actions for the middle, forward and back mouse buttons
 * Configurable Ctrl/Shift + mouse button actions for all 5 mouse buttons
 * One character unicode indicators characters to indicate group window count, minimized status and pinned status
 * Total control over which window-list buttons have labels, and what the label contents are
