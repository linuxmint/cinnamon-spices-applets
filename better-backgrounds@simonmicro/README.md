A Cinnamon desktop applet to change your wallpaper to random images from many customizable sources and also some effects from ImageMagick.

## Currently supported sources ##

* [Bing](https://www.bing.com/) (no resolution modifiers available)
* [Himawari 8](https://himawari8.nict.go.jp/) (live earth wallpaper)
* [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos/)
* [PlaceKitten](http://placekitten.com/) (does not really respect resolution modifiers)
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) (random photos with tags)
* Websites (page is rendered as screenshot by [cutycapt](http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/))

## Known issues ##
* The icon animation needs much CPU power (up to one core), see [here](https://github.com/Simonmicro/better-backgrounds/issues/13#issuecomment-700317345)
