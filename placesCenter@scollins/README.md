Places Center
-------------

Places Center is a feature-rich, cross-platform Cinnamon applet that provides easy access to all of your most-used places.

#### Features
* All entries are file manager independent (which means that they should work for nautilus, nemo, and probably any other file manager as well)
* Option to display all volumes, or just the ones that are mounted
* Supports bookmarks (eg. from Nemo)
* Supports additional user defined places
* Easy to read layout with multiple columns
* Ability to set the panel icon and text (symbolic icons supported)
* Option to show recent documents (click on a recent document to open it; right-click to open the folder that contains it)
* Quick keyboard access (default super+p)
* Search tool that allows you to quickly search for files and folders (supports regular expressions)
* Add middle click to open
