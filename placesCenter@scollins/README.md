Places Center
-------------

Places Center is a feature-rich, cross-platform Cinnamon applet that provides easy access to all of your most-used places.

#### Features

* Option to display all volumes, or just the ones that are mounted
* Supports bookmarks (eg. from Nemo)
* Supports additional user defined places
* Easy to read layout with multiple columns
* Ability to set the panel icon and text (symbolic icons supported)
* Option to show recent documents
* Quick keyboard access (default super+p)
* Search tool that allows you to quickly search for files and folders (supports regular expressions)
* Add middle click to open
