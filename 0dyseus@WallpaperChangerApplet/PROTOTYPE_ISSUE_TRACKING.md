**Important note:** Do not try to install and force compatibility for any other version of Cinnamon older than 3.0.x. As a protection mechanism, the applet will auto-remove itself from the panel.

## Features

- Possibility to create and switch between several profiles. A profile is simply a list of images and/or folders containing images that this applet will use to switch the wallpaper.
- Possibility to preview the next wallpaper from this applet menu.
- Wallpapers can be switched on demand from the controls found in this applet menu.
- The wallpapers rotation can be alphabetical or random.
- The wallpapers rotation can be defined by an interval in seconds or hourly.
- Possibility to open the next or current wallpapers from this applet menu.
- Possibility to display a notification every time the wallpaper is switched.
- Configurable hotkeys to switch to next/previous wallpaper.
- Read the tooltips of each option on this applet settings window for more details.

**Note:** This applet doesn't complement the Cinnamon option called **Play backgrounds as a slideshow**, it replaces it. The Cinnamon option should be disabled at all times for this applet to work as expected. No worries, nothing *fatal* could happen.
