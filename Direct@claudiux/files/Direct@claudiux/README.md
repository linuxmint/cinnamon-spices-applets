# Direct

This Direct applet provides direct and easy access to your Directories, Favorites, Recent documents and System locations.

The Direct@claudiux applet is a fork from the placesCenter@scollins applet, with several improvements and additions.

## Features

* Easy to read layout with multiple columns.
* All entries are file manager independent (which means that they should work for nautilus, nemo, and probably any other file manager as well).
* Option to display all **volumes**, or just the ones that are mounted.
* Supports **bookmarks** (eg. from Nemo).
* Supports additional user defined places.
* Ability to set the panel icon and text (symbolic icons supported).
* Option to show **favorite** documents.
* Option to show **recent** documents (click on a recent document to open it; right-click to open the folder that contains it).
* Quick keyboard access (choose your **shortcut**).
* **Search tool** that allows you to quickly search for files and folders (supports regular expressions).
* Use the middle click to open the folder you have selected (default: your personal home folder).

## Icon browser

*This is optional, but very useful.*

You can install the *yad* package. This will allow you to use the *yad-icon-browser* program to browse icons, choose the one you want, and copy/paste its name. After install, please restart this applet or Cinnamon.

This icon browser, once installed, can then be accessed via a button in the User and System tabs of this applet settings.
