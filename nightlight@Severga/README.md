This is a Cinnamon applet for changing screen color temperature.
This applet was inspired by SCT Toggle applet by @skulptist.de and also uses 'sct' command, nevertheless it works differently. The applet has 3 modes - off, on and auto (simply click the applet with your left mouse button). The auto mode uses your schedule from the applet configuration.

## Requirements
The applet is a frontend for 'sct' command and, thus, requires the 'sct' package to be installed.

## Installation
Download and enable via Cinnamon Settings or panel popup menu.
