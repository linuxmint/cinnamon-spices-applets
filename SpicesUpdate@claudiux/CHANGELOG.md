### v6.3.1~20201026

  * Some optimizations.

### v6.0.1~20200806

"Weight" reduction of this applet: the `Symbola` font is no longer included in its package; it was only used for Arch and the `install_symbola_on_Arch.sh` script was modified to download it if needed.

### v6.0.0~20200729

Many improvements, only for Cinnamon 4.2 and following.

  * Spices Update automatically adapts the verification or not of each type of Spices (for example: it does not check the themes if no theme is installed; it checks them as soon as at least one theme is installed). However, the user is always free to decide, in settings, what should be done.

  * Checking for new Spices is now disabled by default.

  * New option in General Settings: "Show the 'Update All' button in notifications" (with buttons). For example, clicking on this button in a notification for available Themes updates:
    1. opens the Download tab of System Settings about Themes,
    2. refreshes the cache about Themes,
    3. downloads and install all latest updates for your Themes.
    4. When all updates are made, just close yourself this System Settings window.

  * New button 'Forget' in notifications about new Spices.
  * The applet icon now rotates during the entire refresh process.
  * Displays a notification asking the user to check the applet settings, if this is the first installation of this version of Spices Updates. This notification only appears once.
  * Better management of notifications. Spices Update does not use notify-send anymore.
  * Help button (in menu) shows in the browser by default an approximate translation of the web page: https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/309
