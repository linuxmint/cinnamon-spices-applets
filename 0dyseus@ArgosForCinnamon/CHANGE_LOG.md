actually useful error message (¬¬).

- **Author:** Odyseus

```
Argos for Cinnamon applet
- Third prototype.
- Added tooltip to applet. It will display the script name, the execution interval, the rotation
interval, the amount of time that the script took to launch and the amount of time that the applet
took to process the script's output.
- Tested applet on all versions of Cinnamon.
- Implemented plural forms on some translatable strings. **@translators:** Keep an eye on those in
case there are errors.
- *Strictified* all comparisons. Shortcut for *I changed all == to ===*, etc.
- Implemented a better/more informative way of informing about missing dependencies.

```
Argos for Cinnamon

script when the applet is first placed in a panel. This allows to create an example menu localized
if there is a localization language available.
