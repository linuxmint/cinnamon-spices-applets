# Bing Desktop Wallpaper for Cinnamon

A Cinnamon applet to apply the daily Bing Wallpaper to your Cinnamon Desktop Background

Inspired by the [Gnome Shell extension](https://github.com/neffo/bing-wallpaper-gnome-extension)

The Bing Image of the Day will be downloaded, and applied as the Desktop Background. A new image should appear each day, as soon as it becomes available.

The resolution used is 4k or greater (UHD). This will give the best quality and can be resized by Cinnamon (change the Picture aspect in Backgrounds -> Settings if needed)
