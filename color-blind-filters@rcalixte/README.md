COLOR-BLIND FILTERS
===================
An applet for the Cinnamon Desktop Environment that offers full-screen color
filters that should help color-blind users and developers.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Color filters that should help color-blind users and also developers.
The menu includes correction filters and also simulation filters that can show
you what color-blind people see. Included are filters for Protanopia,
Deuteranopia and Tritanopia. Filter strength is adjustable. Also available are
filters for desaturation, channel mix, and lightness and color inversions.

The primary mouse click on the applet icon toggles the menu and the secondary
mouse click opens the configuration menu. The configuration options are
identical to the applet menu and are provided for convenience. Options changed
via either interface will synchronize to the other.

Portions of this code and images were adapted from the Colorblind Filters GNOME
extension created by [George dH](https://github.com/G-dH).

COMPATIBILITY
-------------
This applet has been tested to be compatible with Cinnamon 5.4+.
