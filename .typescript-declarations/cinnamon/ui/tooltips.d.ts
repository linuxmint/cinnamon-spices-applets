	/**
	 *
	 * This is a base class for other tooltip items to inherit. This cannot be
	 * instantiated.
	 *
	 * All other tooltip items inherit this object. This base class is responsible
	 * for listening to mouse events and determining when to show the tooltip. When
	 * it thinks a tooltip should be shown, it calls `this.show()`. When it thinks
	 * it should be hidden, it calls `this.hide()`. When the @item is destroyed, it
	 * will call `this._destroy()`;
	 *
	 * Any object wishing to implement a tooltip should inherit this class, and
	 * then implement the three functions above. It should be noted that the sole
	 * responsibility of this class is to call the three functions above. It is
	 * thus the user's job to create the tooltip actor and position it correctly in
	 * the `show` function. Example implementations for reference include the
	 * #Tooltips.Tooltip object as well as the `WindowPreview` object in the window
	 * list applet.
	 *
	 * When calling the `show` function, #TooltipBase will set the
	 * `this.mousePosition` to the mouse coordinates at which the event is
	 * triggered.
	 *
	 * When implementing the `show` and `hide` functions, the user should set the
	 * `this.visible` variable to the visibility state of the tooltip. This is
	 * since calling the `show` function does not necessarily actually show the
	 * tooltip, eg. when the tooltip text is empty and the tooltip refuses to show.
	 * The `this.visible` variable should be set properly to reflect the actual
	 * status of the tooltip.
	 *
	 * Finally, if the user wishes to inhibit the display of a tooltip, eg. when
	 * the owner is being dragged, they can set the `this.preventShow` variable to
	 * `true`.
