# cinnamon-weather

Adaptation of Gnome Shell's [weather extension](https://github.com/simon04/gnome-shell-extension-weather) for the Cinnamon desktop.

cinnamon-weather uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).  For the current version number, see `metadata.json`.  

## Versions

Versions are automatically selected based on you Cinnamon's version.

- [Cinnamon](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon) **3.0+ is End-of-Life, won't receive more updates**
- [Cinnamon](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon) 3.8+ is the currently supported version.

----

## Configuration

Right-click to access `cinnamon-settings` -> *Applets -> Configure*.

### Location

The applet obtains the location automatically. If the automatic location not adequate for you, you can use the **Manual Location** mode where the applet either accepts:

* **Coordinates** in Latitude, Longitude format (e.g. 37.77,122.41). You can use [OpenWeatherMap's finder](https://openweathermap.org/find) and paste the coordinates in from there.
* or an **Address** (it can be just a city and country, it is pretty flexible). After 3 seconds, the applet will replace the text that you entered with the full address it finds so you can verify if it's correct. You can also get your exact address to enter from [OpenStreetMap's Nominatim search](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/), the service the applet uses.

You can also save locations what you entered manually and switch between them in the applet *(arrows will appear on both sides of the location in the applet if you have more than two saved)*.

- Only allows 1500 calls a day, so 15min refresh cycle is recommended.
- Weather Underground is a global community of people connecting data from environmental sensors like weather stations (250.000) and air quality monitors so they can provide the rich, hyperlocal data you need.
- You need an API key. If you don't have a weather station to share data with WU, you can't have an API key. However, you can add a Raspberry Pi as a device for the weather station choice when [registering](https://www.wunderground.com/signup), even if you don't have one, and it will get you the API key.
- Disclaimer: Observations don't provide weather conditions so the forecast one for the day is used.

### Usage of "Override label on panel", "Override location label" and "Override tooltip on panel" setting

The setting allows you to make the applet display basically anything in the form of text in the panel (and other places). In addition, it exposes a number of values for you to use as you like, these will be replaced with actual data values. The full text-to-value mapping can be found below.

## Language Translations

If you want to update or change the translation in your language other than English, here are some steps to get you started. Keep in mind that your local changes will be overwritten when an update of the applets language is installed. Feel free to share your translation, which is very much appreciated, 
by making a PR (pull request) on Github or contact the current maintainer of the applet.

1. Install the translation editor **poedit** with your package manager and download your language PO file e. g. *xx.po* where xx is your ISO language code, and the template POT file *[weather@mockturtl.pot](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/tree/master/weather%40mockturtl/files/weather%40mockturtl/po/weather@mockturtl.pot)* from the *files/weather@mockturtl/po/* sub directory on the [Github website](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/tree/master/weather%40mockturtl/files/weather%40mockturtl/po/)

2. Start **poedit** and open your downloaded PO file *xx.po*, then go to menu *Catalogue* or *Translate* depending on version, choose *"Update from POT file…"* and open the POT file *[weather@mockturtl.pot](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/tree/master/weather%40mockturtl/files/weather%40mockturtl/po/weather@mockturtl.pot)*. Start your editing and try to use previously contributed translations as much as possible and get familiar with the correct technical weather terms for things in your language.

3. When done translating, click on *Validate* and *Save*. This creates a new MO file that you can use locally in your system by overwriting the file *~/.local/share/locale/xx/LC_MESSAGES/weather@mockturtl.mo* and restart your system to check how your translation works.

## Known Issues

* Hourly forecast toggle button is not centered to the middle of the popup menu

* Sunset/Sunrise is not displayed correctly if there is a mismatch between the Location Timezone and System Timezone when using Manual Location with some of the weather providers

* DarkSky verbose conditions are only in cm/Celsius or in/Fahrenheit

### Report a new issue

You need a Github login to make a issue report. Please first check if the issue already is reported [here](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+weather). You will find more information about reporting in the Configuration under the Help Tab, accessible by right clicking on the applet. Here you can save logs to file with debug level that is much appreciated. By using the *Submit an Issue* Button under this Tab, useful system information will be generated for your report form in your default web browser at Github.com. 

### Troubleshooting

#### Enabling debug mode

You can enable debug mode for more logging by creating a file named ```DEBUG``` in the folder of the applet here: ```~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/weather@mockturtl/```, then restart Cinnamon.

#### See the logs producing by applets

You can see Logs by opening the Cinnamon 'Looking Glass' debugger. You can open it by Right Clicking on your Panel (taskbar), then Troubleshoot->Looking Glass

Logs can be found under the ```Log``` Tab.
