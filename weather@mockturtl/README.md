# cinnamon-weather

Adaptation of Gnome Shell's [weather extension](https://github.com/simon04/gnome-shell-extension-weather) for the Cinnamon desktop.

cinnamon-weather uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).  For the current version number, see `metadata.json`.  

----

## Setup

**The applet obtains the location automatically, see below what the weather providers offer and how to obtain API keys if your chosen weather provider needs one.**

In **Manual Location** mode the applet either accepts:

* **Coordinates** in Latitude, Longitude format (e.g. 37.77,122.41). You can use [OpenWeatherMap's finder](https://openweathermap.org/find) and paste the coordinates in from there.
* or an **Address** (it can be just a city and country, it is pretty flexible). After 3 seconds, the applet will replace what you entered with the full address what it finds so you can verify if it's correct. You can also get your exact address to enter from [OpenStreetMap's Nominatim search](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/), that's what the applet uses as well.

You can also save locations what you entered manually and switch between them in the applet *(arrows will appear on both sides of the location in the applet if you have more than two saved)*.

This is the default provider that works out of the box. Big Thanks to them supporting free open source projects, like this!

### MET Norway

Free meteorological data and forecasts from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute founded in 1866. [Link](https://www.met.no/en)

* Current weather is shown for the next hour, and the daily forecasts are generated from 6 hour forecasts, so there is a possibility that they are inaccurate sometimes.

* The service is global with open weather data.

* Sometimes it takes like 5-10 seconds to obtain weather, please be patient when it loads up the first time.

* Only covers the UK

* It uses the nearest forecast site and observation sites in an 50km area, it displays an error if it does not find any. Please open a new issue if this happens and you live in the UK! (There are much less observation sites than forecast sites.)

### US National Weather

The National Weather Service in the USA is a federal government agency formed in 1861. [Link](https://www.weather.gov/)

* Sometimes it takes 10-15 seconds to obtain weather, please be patient when it loads up the first time.

* Only covers the US

* Observations are quite spotty so it combines multiple observation stations if needed in a 50km area.

## Working with Language Translations

If you want to update or change the translation in your language other than English, here are some  steps to get you started. Keep in mind that your local changes will be overwritten when an update of the applets language is installed. Feel free to share your translation, which is very much appreciated, 
by making a PR (pull request) on Github or contact the current maintainer of the applet.

1. Install the translation editor **poedit** with your package manager and download your language PO file e. g. *xx.po* where xx is your ISO language code, and the template POT file *[weather@mockturtl.pot](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/tree/master/weather%40mockturtl/files/weather%40mockturtl/po/weather@mockturtl.pot)* from the *files/weather@mockturtl/po/* sub directory on the [Github website](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/tree/master/weather%40mockturtl/files/weather%40mockturtl/po/)

2. Start **poedit** and open your downloaded PO file *xx.po*, then go to menu *Catalogue*, choose *Update from POT fileâ€¦* and open the POT file *[weather@mockturtl.pot](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/tree/master/weather%40mockturtl/files/weather%40mockturtl/po/weather@mockturtl.pot)*. Start your editing and try to use previously contributed translations as much as possible and get familiar with the correct technical weather terms for things in your language.

3. When done translating, click on *Validate* and *Save*. This creates a new MO file that you can use locally in your system by overwriting the file *~/.local/share/locale/xx/LC_MESSAGES/weather@mockturtl.mo* and restart your system to check how your translation works.

## Known Issues

* Hourly forecast toggle button is not centered to the middle of the popup menu

* Sunset/Sunrise is not displayed correctly if there is a mismatch between the Location Timezone and System Timezone when using Manual Location with some of the weather providers (Yahoo, for example)

* DarkSky verbose conditions are only in cm/Celsius or in/Fahrenheit

### Troubleshooting

#### Enabling debug mode

You can enable debug mode for more logging by creating a file named ```DEBUG``` in the folder of the applet here: ```~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/weather@mockturtl/```, then restart Cinnamon.

#### See the logs producing by applets

You can see Logs by opening the Cinnamon 'Looking Glass' debugger. You can open it by Right Clicking on your Panel (taskbar), then Troubleshoot->Looking Glass

Logs can be found under the ```Log``` Tab.
