## 2.3.0

* Fixed Issues with Debian, now polyfilled Promises when needed
* Reworked on how to import from other files, now in line with other applets

* Added some basic Typescript declarations of Cinnamon js libraries (minimum needed for the applet)
* Added Build scripts and Build guide
* Text 'Today' and 'Tomorrow' is used for forecasts in 3.8+
* Version 3.6 changed to 3.4 and using the Typescript source compiled to es5 with some extra changes after:
  * All files moved into One file
  * code regarding importing other files was removed
  * .ToLocaleString() does not support Timezones, removed
  * Array.includes polyfill added (it is used in DarkSky)

Fixes:

* !!! the panel was not rebuilding at the correct time on refresh (I
  honestly don't know how the app was working before at all), now
  rebuilding is part of the data refresh function.
* Applet was crashing when there was no internet (Debug line was outside try/catch)
* Big performance increase in version 3.4, plus DarkSky support

* Version bump

* Day names are now properly translated

## 2.1.4

* Applet did not load on Cinnamon version 3.6, it seems it needs the separate folder named 3.6.  
  So now we have 3.8 for 3.8+, 3.6 for 3.6, and everything below uses the version in root. All working for real now..
* DarkSky was not using TimeZone information for displaying times and forecast days

## 2.1.3

* Multiversion fix. Everything below 3.8 should use the previous
  version now (3.6 version moved to the root folder), because it does not
  even work with version 3.2 at the moment.
* Small addition for DarkSky condition processing for shorter conditions.

## 2.1.2

**3.6**

* OpenWeatherMap using FOSS key and proper daily forecasts.

**3.8**

* Removed "require"-s, swapped them to imports
* Fixed bug when Cinnamon froze when the taskbar was manipulated when the applet was enabled on it.
* DarkSky was Getting the Forecast day names from sunrise time, fixed
* Humidity is rounded now.
* Location element is a button again, opens Data services webpages
  with more weather, or it can trigger a refresh if there was an error
  (there is no need anymore, but still).

## 2.1.1

* Openweathermap no longer requires key
* Forcing main loop to refresh when Weather update fails (it was not
  updating for a whole refresh interval when we had a successful update
  then the settings was changed right after and update failed)
* Using Regex against Location setting
* DarkSky error messages are displayed properly to the users now
* Fixed some OpenWeatherMap json response error handling (it was matching strings to numbers)
* Removed obsolete code
* Edited Readme
* Added some thanks to OpenWeatherMap at the bottom of the settings

## 2.0.1

* Fixed issue where sunset/sunrise displayed twice
* Forecast compiling uses timezone calculation to separate forecasts to the correct days now
* Fixed issue where days were displayed incorrectly, now are
  calculated displayed with timezone offset (was bad with people near the
  day boundary i guess)
* using HTTPS to call OpenWeather

## 2.0.0

* Pull request to make the weather applet functional again after Yahoo API changes

* Added capability to support more than 1 API, but only OpenWeatherMap is implemented at the moment.
